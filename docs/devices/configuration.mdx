Data transfer is an integral part of device integration. The device integration protocol generally enables the
remote access and transfer of data. Both these can be set up separately, with neither relying on the other.

There are basically two approaches for the data transfer configurations,
- Automatic data transfer
- Manual transfer

While the manual transfer refers to manually collecting, generally using a USB storage device, there are several
approaches for the automatic transfer as follows,
- transferring data through **email provider**
- **exe** running as a program
- **powershell script** running as a background service
- macro

In this part we mostly discuss the configurations required to run exe as a program to collect the data automatically.
Initially we have to generate an exe file with custom input fields specifying the source, destination along with other
some other configuration data. We can generate the exe file from the [EFW builder](http://193.196.38.127/). It is a
service which generates the exe in a secured manner. Though user registration is not allowed currently, new users can be
created upon contacting the admin of the EFW builder. Please feel free to [contact](/docs/eln/specific_contact) us if
you need the service.

The rest of the configurations are as follows,
- Login to the EFW builder at http://193.196.38.127/
- Create a new EFW executable file by with all necessary inputs

- Download the executable file.
- (Optional) Copy the efw.exe to the target directory on your target machine
- Create a Scheduled Task to trigger at startup
  - Copy the task_example.vbs into the startup directory
    - Hint: Windows Key + R to open run and type shell:startup. This will open Task Scheduler
  - Replace the full path of the executable file in the script
  - After restarting the computer, check from Task Manager if the schedule task is created and the application
  process is running

:::info NB
After editing the scheduling script, the computer needs to be restarted
